# Primary-Financial-Account
Overview
This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for the Primary Financial Account (PFA) project. Inspired by discussions on decentralized finance and personal financial sovereignty (e.g., Cryptso's article on Paragraph.xyz), this project aims to create a framework or toolset for managing a self-sovereign financial account using modern blockchain and cryptographic technologies.
The PFA concept envisions a single, user-controlled financial hub that integrates assets, transactions, and identity verification without relying on traditional centralized institutions.
Features
Decentralized Identity: Leverage blockchain-based identity solutions (e.g., DIDs) for secure, private account ownership.

Asset Management: Support for multiple cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets.

Smart Contract Integration: Automate financial operations like savings, payments, or investments.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work with popular wallets and dApps.

Open Source: Fully transparent and community-driven development.
